abstract = {As a key part of the serverless computing paradigm, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms enable users to run arbitrary functions without being concerned about operational issues. However, there are several performance-related issues surrounding the state-of-the-art FaaS platforms that can deter widespread adoption of FaaS, including sizeable overheads, unreliable performance, and new forms of the cost-performance trade-off. In this work we, the SPEC RG Cloud Group, identify six performance-related challenges that arise specifically in this FaaS model, and present our roadmap to tackle these problems in the near future. This paper aims at motivating the community to solve these challenges together.},

abstract = {In this paper, we leverage a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for topic modeling consisting of three functions for data preprocessing, model training, and inferencing to analyze serverless platform performance variation. Specifically, we investigated performance using x86_64 and ARM64 processors over a 24-hour day starting at midnight local time on four cloud regions across three continents on AWS Lambda. We identified public cloud resource contention by leveraging the CPU steal metric, and examined relationships to NLP pipeline runtime. Intel x86_64 Xeon processors at the same clock rate as ARM64 processors (Graviton 2) were more than 23\% faster for model training, but ARM64 processors were faster for data preprocessing and inferencing. Use of the Intel x86_64 architecture for the NLP pipeline was up to 33.4\% more expensive than ARM64 as a result of incentivized pricing from the cloud provider and slower pipeline runtime due to greater resource contention for Intel processors.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms enable easy deployment and hosting of code known as serverless functions and have gained considerable traction among software developers. Recently, Amazon has offered ARM64 processors as an alternative to x86 for hosting serverless functions on AWS Lambda. To encourage developers to migrate code to ARM64, use of ARM64 processors has been incentivized with a 20\% discount. In this paper, we investigate the implications of adopting ARM64 processors for hosting serverless functions. We deploy and benchmark 18 distinct serverless functions that stress a variety of system resources. Additionally, we scaled up the runtime for each of our functions by increasing the work they performed using 40 incremental steps to increase runtime from a few seconds to several minutes. We compared performance differences of x86 vs. ARM64 processors for our serverless function workoads and present our findings summarizing differences in: CPU utilization, function runtime, function runtime variation, and hosting costs. While only 7 of 18 functions ran faster on ARM64, 15 of 18 were less expensive thanks to the cloud provider discount. Performance variation on ARM64 processors was less than half compared to x86 processors potentially from the lack of hyperthreading and lower resource contention for ARM64 CPUs.},
