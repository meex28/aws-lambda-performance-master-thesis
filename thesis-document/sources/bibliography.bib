abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) describes cloud computing services that make infrastructure components transparent to application developers, thus falling in the larger group of “serverless” computing models. When using FaaS offerings, such as AWS Lambda, developers provide atomic and short-running code for their functions, and FaaS providers execute and horizontally scale them on-demand. Currently, there is no systematic research on how developers use serverless, what types of applications lend themselves to this model, or what architectural styles and practices FaaS-based applications are based on. We present results from a mixed-method study, combining interviews with practitioners who develop applications and systems that use FaaS, a systematic analysis of grey literature, and a Web-based survey. We find that successfully adopting FaaS requires a different mental model, where systems are primarily constructed by composing pre-existing services, with FaaS often acting as the “glue” that brings these services together. Tooling availability and maturity, especially related to testing and deployment, remains a major difficulty. Further, we find that current FaaS systems lack systematic support for function reuse, and abstractions and programming models for building non-trivial FaaS applications are limited. We conclude with a discussion of implications for FaaS providers, software developers, and researchers.}

However, there are several performance-related issues surrounding the state-of-the-art FaaS platforms that can deter widespread adoption of FaaS, including sizeable overheads, unreliable performance, and new forms of the cost-performance trade-off. In this work we, the SPEC RG Cloud Group, identify six performance-related challenges that arise specifically in this FaaS model, and present our roadmap to tackle these problems in the near future.

abstract = {In this paper, we leverage a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for topic modeling consisting of three functions for data preprocessing, model training, and inferencing to analyze serverless platform performance variation. Specifically, we investigated performance using x86_64 and ARM64 processors over a 24-hour day starting at midnight local time on four cloud regions across three continents on AWS Lambda. We identified public cloud resource contention by leveraging the CPU steal metric, and examined relationships to NLP pipeline runtime. Intel x86_64 Xeon processors at the same clock rate as ARM64 processors (Graviton 2) were more than 23\% faster for model training, but ARM64 processors were faster for data preprocessing and inferencing. Use of the Intel x86_64 architecture for the NLP pipeline was up to 33.4\% more expensive than ARM64 as a result of incentivized pricing from the cloud provider and slower pipeline runtime due to greater resource contention for Intel processors.},

abstract = {Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms enable easy deployment and hosting of code known as serverless functions and have gained considerable traction among software developers. Recently, Amazon has offered ARM64 processors as an alternative to x86 for hosting serverless functions on AWS Lambda. To encourage developers to migrate code to ARM64, use of ARM64 processors has been incentivized with a 20\% discount. In this paper, we investigate the implications of adopting ARM64 processors for hosting serverless functions. We deploy and benchmark 18 distinct serverless functions that stress a variety of system resources. Additionally, we scaled up the runtime for each of our functions by increasing the work they performed using 40 incremental steps to increase runtime from a few seconds to several minutes. We compared performance differences of x86 vs. ARM64 processors for our serverless function workoads and present our findings summarizing differences in: CPU utilization, function runtime, function runtime variation, and hosting costs. While only 7 of 18 functions ran faster on ARM64, 15 of 18 were less expensive thanks to the cloud provider discount. Performance variation on ARM64 processors was less than half compared to x86 processors potentially from the lack of hyperthreading and lower resource contention for ARM64 CPUs.},

abstract = {Serverless computing promises auto-scalability and cost-efficiency (in "pay-as-you-go" manner) for high-productive software development. Because of its virtue, serverless computing has motivated increasingly new applications and services in the cloud. This, however, also presents new challenges including how to efficiently design high-performance serverless platforms and how to efficiently program on the platforms.This paper proposes ServerlessBench, an open-source benchmark suite for characterizing serverless platforms. It includes test cases exploring characteristic metrics of serverless computing, e.g., communication efficiency, startup latency, stateless overhead, and performance isolation. We have applied the benchmark suite to evaluate the most popular serverless computing platforms, including AWS Lambda, Open-Whisk, and Fn, and present new serverless implications from the study. For example, we show scenarios where decoupling an application into a composition of serverless functions can be beneficial in cost-saving and performance, and that the "stateless" property in serverless computing can hurt the execution performance of serverless functions. These implications form several design guidelines, which may help platform designers to optimize serverless platforms and application developers to design their functions best fit to the platforms.},

abstract = {The serverless computing model leverages high-level languages, such as JavaScript and Java, to raise the level of abstraction for cloud programming. However, today's design of serverless computing platforms based on stateless short-lived functions leads to missed opportunities for modern runtimes to optimize serverless functions through techniques such as JIT compilation and code profiling.In this paper, we show that modern serverless platforms, such as AWS Lambda, do not fully leverage language runtime optimizations. We find that a significant number of function invocations running on warm containers are executed with unoptimized code (warm-starts), leading to orders of magnitude performance slowdowns.We explore the idea of exploiting the runtime knowledge spread throughout potentially thousands of nodes to profile and optimize code. To that end, we propose Ignite, a serverless platform that orchestrates runtimes across machines to run optimized code from the start (hot-start). We present evidence that runtime orchestration has the potential to greatly reduce cost and latency of serverless workloads by running optimized code across thousands of serverless functions.},

abstract = {We present Nimbus, a framework for writing and deploying Java applications on a Function-as-a-Service ("serverless") platform. Nimbus aims to soothe four main pain points experienced by developers working on serverless applications: that testing can be difficult, that deployment can be a slow and painful process, that it is challenging to avoid vendor lock-in, and that long cold start times can introduce unwelcome latency to function invocations.Nimbus provides a number of features that aim to overcome these challenges when working with serverless applications. It uses an annotation-based configuration to avoid having to work with large configuration files. It aims to allow the code written to be cloud-agnostic. It provides an environment for local testing where the complete application can be run locally before deployment. Lastly, Nimbus provides mechanisms for optimising the contents and size of the artifacts that are deployed to the cloud, which helps to reduce both deployment times and cold start times.Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nYchh8jdY4},

  abstractNote={&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The article contains a performance comparison of two mobile applications, developed in the Java and Kotlin programming languages respectively. The applications took the form of an auto-scroller game and shared their graphics assets. The aim of the work was to confirm or reject the hypothesis: Java is slightly more efficient than Kotlin in the presented context. The subject of comparison was the consumption of CPU, RAM and the device’s battery resources. The mentioned metrics were obtained using the Android Profiler tool. The study was conducted using two mobile devices. The results confirm the research hypothesis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={Journal of Computer Sciences Institute},
